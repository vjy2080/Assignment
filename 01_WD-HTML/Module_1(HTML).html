            HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).</p>

            <li class="inlineList">Unordered List or Bulleted List (ul)</li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :- </Strong>
        </p>
        <p><b> There are three methods to insert a background image in HTML </b></p>
        <ol>
            <li class="inlineList">Using the background attribute in the &lt;body&gt; tag,</li>
            <li class="inlineList">using the background-image property in CSS,</li>

            <p class="note">Note:- The background attribute is not supported by HTML 5, so
                the CSS or HTML element methods are preferred. The background-image property takes a url value, which is
                the
                location of the image. Other CSS properties can be used to adjust the background image's repetition,

        <ul>

            <li class="inlineList"> &lt; br&gt; tag - Usually &lt; br&gt; tag is used to separate the line of text. It
                breaks the current
                line and conveys the
                flow to the next line</li>

            <li class="inlineList"> &lt; p&gt; tag - The
                &lt; p&gt; tag contains the text in the form of a new paragraph.
            </li>
            <li class="inlineList"> &lt; blockquote&gt; tag - It is used to define a large quoted section. If you have a
                large quotation,
                then put the
                entire text within &lt; blockquote&gt; .............&lt; /blockquote&gt; tag.</li>

        <li> What is JavaScript? </li>
        <p><Strong>Answer :-</Strong>
        <ul>
            <li> JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows us to implement complex features on web
                pages.</li>
            <li> Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for us.</li>
            <li> To look at displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling
                video
                jukeboxes, etc.</li>
            <li> We can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</li>
            <li> It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we
                have
                covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</li>
        </ul>

        <li> What is the use of is NaN function? </li>
        <p><Strong>Answer :-</Strong>
        <ul>
            <li>isNaN() is a function property of the global object.</li>
            <li> The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN when converted to a number.</li>
            <li> Because coercion inside the isNaN() function can be surprising, you may alternatively want to use
                Number.isNaN(). </li>
            <li> Return value :- "true" if the given value is NaN after being converted to a number; otherwise, "false".
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <hr class="hr">
        <li> What is negative Infinity? </li>
        <p><Strong>Answer :-</Strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY static data property represents the negative Infinity value.</li>
           <li> Any positive value, including POSITIVE_INFINITY, multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NEGATIVE_INFINITY.</li>
           <li> Any negative value, including NEGATIVE_INFINITY, multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is POSITIVE_INFINITY.</li>
           <li> Any positive value divided by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is negative zero (as defined in IEEE 754).</li>
           <li> Any negative value divided by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is positive zero (as defined in IEEE 754).</li>
           <li> Zero multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NaN.</li>
           <li> NaN multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NaN.</li>
           <li> NEGATIVE_INFINITY, divided by any negative value except NEGATIVE_INFINITY, is POSITIVE_INFINITY.</li>
           <li> NEGATIVE_INFINITY, divided by any positive value except POSITIVE_INFINITY, is NEGATIVE_INFINITY.</li>
           <li> NEGATIVE_INFINITY, divided by either NEGATIVE_INFINITY or POSITIVE_INFINITY, is NaN.</li>
           <li> x > Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY is true for any number x that isn't NEGATIVE_INFINITY.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
           <li> Undeclared variables are those that have not been declared or defined in the current scope.</li>
           <li> While undefined variables are those that have been declared but not given a value.</li>

        <ul>
           <li> A ViewState is a state of a page within a browser wherein the values of controls persist when post back operation is done.</li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :-</Strong>
        <ul>
           <li> The strict equality ( === ) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result.</li>
           <li> Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.</li>

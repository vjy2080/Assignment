        <li> What are the benefits of using CSS? </li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :-</Strong>
        <ul>

            <li  >CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a
                repeated style for element once & use it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply
                the required styles.</li>
            <li  >The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently across
                variety of sites. One instruction can control several areas which is advantageous.</li>
            <li  >Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page improving
                site speed.</li>
            <li  >Cascading sheet not only simplifies website development, but also simplifies
                the maintenance as a change of one line of code affects the whole web site and maintenance time.
            </li>
            <li  >It is less complex therefore the effort are significantly reduced.</li>
            <li  >It helps to form spontaneous and consistent changes.</li>
            <li  >CSS changes are device friendly. With people employing a batch of various
                range of smart devices to access websites over the web, there's a requirement for responsive web
                design.</li>
            <li  >It has the power for re-positioning. It helps us to determine the changes
                within the position of web elements who are there on the page.</li>
            <li  >These bandwidth savings are substantial figures of insignificant tags that
                are indistinct from a mess of pages.</li>
            <li  >Easy for the user to customize the online page</li>
            <li  >It reduces the file transfer size.</li>

        <li> What are the disadvantages of CSS? </li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :- </Strong>
        <ul>
            <li  >CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among web browsers.</li>
            <li  >With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web
                developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.</li>
            <li  >There exists a scarcity of security.</li>
            <li  >After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The
                similar change affects on all the browsers.</li>
            <li  >The programming language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners.
                Different levels of CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.</li>
            <li  >Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).</li>
            <li  >CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports CSS as different
                logic.</li>
            <li  >There might be cross-browser issues while using CSS.</li>
            <li  >There are multiple levels which creates confusion for non-developers and beginners.

        <hr>
        <li> What do you understand by CSS opacity? </li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :- </Strong>
        <ul>
            <li  > The opacity property sets the opacity level for an element.</li>
            <li  > The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where 1 is not transparent at
                all, 0.5 is 50% see-through, and 0 is completely transparent.</li>
            <p class="note"> Note: When using the opacity property to add transparency to the background of an element,
                all of its child elements become transparent as well. This can make the text inside a fully transparent
                element hard to read. If you do not want to apply opacity to child elements, use RGBA color values
                instead

        <li> How can the background color of an element be changed? </li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :- </Strong> 
        <h4>We can set background color of an element by css like below example :-</h4>
        <h4>In below example we are set "red background color" to Heading-1</h4>

        <code>
                <pre>
            &lt;html&gt;

            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;style&gt;
                    h1 {
                        background-color: red;
                    }
                &lt;/style&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;

            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;This is Heading-1 with Background color Red&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;

            &lt;/html&gt;
        </pre>

        <li> How can image repetition of the backup be controlled? </li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :- </Strong>
        <ul>
            <li  > To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat
                property.</li>
            <li  > If we want only horizontally repeat so we can use - "repeat-x"</li>
            <li  > If we want only vertically repeat so we can use - "repeat-y"</li>
            <li  > We can use no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if we do not want to
                repeat an image vertically or horizontally,</li>
            <li  > In this case, the image will display only once.</li>

        <li> What is the use of the background-position property? </li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :- </Strong>
        <ul>
            <li  >A position defines an x/y coordinate, to place an item relative to the edges of an
                element's box.</li>
            <li  >It can be defined using one to four values.</li>
            <li  >If two non-keyword values are used, the first value represents the horizontal
                position and the second represents the vertical position.</li>
            <li  >If only one value is specified, the second value is assumed to be center.</li>
            <li  >If three or four values are used, the length-percentage values are offsets for the
                preceding keyword value(s).</li>

        <ul>
            <li  >The background-attachment property in CSS is used to specify the kind of attachment
                of the background image with respect to its container.</li>
            <li  >It can be set to scroll or make it remain fixed. It can be applied to all HTML

        <hr>
        <li> Why should background and color be used as separate properties? </li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :- </Strong>
        <h4  > This is done for two reasons:-</h4>
        <ol>
            <li  > It makes style sheets easier to read. </li>
            <li  > When combined with color, the CSS background property becomes even more complex.

        <li> How to center block elements using CSS1? </li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :- </Strong>
        <h4  > There are two steps to center a block-level element :- </h4>
        <ul>
            <li  > <b> Step 1: </b> Define the external width - We need to define the external width.
                Block-level elements have the default width of 100% of the webpage, so for centering the block element,
                we need space around it. So for generating the space, we are giving it a width.</li>
            <br>
            <li  > <b> Step 2: </b> Set the left-margin and the right-margin of the element to auto -
                Since we produced a remaining space by providing external width so now we need to align that space
                properly that's why we should use margin property. Margin is a property that tells how to align a
                remaining space. So for centering the element you must set left-margin to auto and right-margin to auto.

        <h4  >To integrate CSS on a web page, you have 3 options:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li  > Inline CSS: You can add CSS styles directly to an HTML element using the "style"
                attribute.</li>
            <li  > Internal CSS: You can add CSS styles to the head section of an HTML document using
                the "style" tag.
            </li>
            <li  > External CSS: You can create a separate CSS file and link it to your HTML document
                using the "link" tag
                in the head section.</li>

        <li> What is embedded style sheets? </li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :- </Strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Internal CSS is called as embedded style sheet</li>
            <li>The CSS syntax for embedded style sheets is exactly the same as other CSS code.</li>

            <pre>
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;style&gt;
            We can write our CSS here as "Embedded style sheet"
        &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;

</pre>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <hr>
        <li> What are the external style sheets? </li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :- </Strong>
        <ul>
            <li> External CSS contains separate CSS files that contain only style properties with the help of tag
                attributes (For example class, id, heading, … etc).</li>
            <li> CSS property is written in a separate file with a .css extension and should be linked to the HTML
                document using a link tag.</li>
            <li> It means that, for each element, style can be set only once and will be applied across web pages.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre>
            &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
            &lt; link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" class="style" &gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;

        <hr>
        <li> What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets? </li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :- </Strong>
        <h4> The advantages of External Style Sheets are:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Using them, the styles of multiple documents can be controlled from one file.</li>
            <li>Classes can be created for use on multiple HTML element types in many documents.</li>
            <li>In complex situations, selector and grouping methods can be used to apply styles.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4> The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In order to import style information for each document, an extra download is needed.</li>
            <li>Until the external style sheet is loaded, it may not be possible to render the document.</li>

        <p><Strong>Answer :- </Strong>
        <ul>

            <li> The curly braces and everything inside is a declaration block.</li>

            <li> Each key/value pair, as separated by a colon and ending in a semicolon, is a declaration.</li>
            <li> In those key/value pairs, the key is a property (or property name), and the value is a value (or
                property value).</li>

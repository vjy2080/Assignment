    <h2> Question No.2 <br>What is promises</h2>
    <hr class="hr">
        <h3 class="text-center">ANSWER</h3>

        
           <P class="text-center">a promise is an object that represents the eventual outcome of an asynchronous task. It can be in one of three states:
            <ol>
               <li>Pending: The initial state when the asynchronous task hasn't completed yet.</li>
               <li>Fulfilled: The state when the asynchronous task has completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.</li>
               <li>Rejected: The state when the asynchronous task has encountered an error or failure, and the promise has a reason for the failure.</li>
            </ol>
           </P>
           <h4 class="text-center">In the diagram provided below, we can clearly understand its concept.</h4>
